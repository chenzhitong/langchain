# Deploying and invoking contract

In the previous section we have compiled an NEP17 contract file (NEP17.nef) and contract descriptive file (NEP17.manifest.json), next we will move on to deployment and invocation of the contract with Neo-CLI.

## Deploying contract

In Neo-CLI, input the deploy command  `deploy <nefFilePath> [manifestFile]` , for example:

```bash
deploy NEP17.nef
```

Or

```bash
deploy NEP17.nef NEP17.manifest.json
```

After the command is executed, the NEP17 contract is deployed and the related fee is charged by the system automatically.

```bash
neo> deploy NEP17.nef
Script hash: 0xb7f4d011241ec13db16c0e3484bdd5dd9a536f26
Gas: 10.1477624

Signed and relayed transaction with hash=0xe03aade81fb96c44e115a1cc9cfe984a9df4a283bd10aa0aefa7ebf3e296f757
```

For more information, refer to [Deploying Smart Contracts](../develop/deploy/deploy.md).

## Invoking contract

Now we can invoke the contract using the Neo-CLI command `invoke`:

```bash
invoke <scriptHash> <operation> [contractParameters=null] [witnessAddress=null]
```

For example:

```bash
invoke 0xb7f4d011241ec13db16c0e3484bdd5dd9a536f26 symbol
```

After executed successfully, the following information is printedï¼š

```bash
Invoking script with: '10c00c046e616d650c14f9f81497c3f9b62ba93f73c711d41b1eeff50c2341627d5b52'
VM State: HALT
Gas Consumed: 0.0103609
Evaluation Stack: [{"type":"ByteArray","value":"VG9rZW5TeW1ib2w="}]

relay tx(no|yes):
```

Where:

- VM State: `HALT` indicates the vm executed successfully;  `FAULT` indicates the vm exited during execution due to an exception.
- Evaluation Stack: the result of contract execution, where the value is encoded with Base64 when it is a string or ByteArray.
- You can do the data format conversion [here](https://neo.org/converter/) `VG9rZW5TeW1ib2w=` => `TokenSymbol`
